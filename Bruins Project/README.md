# Bruins Developer Assignment

## Backend
The backend is written in Flask/Python.  It contains a couple of useful endpoints for accessing the NHL's publicly accessible API.  You may edit/extend this code as you see fit.  

Note: It is possible to directly request the NHL API from your frontend.  However, we'd prefer you to send requests through the Flask API.

### Backend Quick Start
1. First validate that you've installed Python >=3.4 and pip
2. Install the requirements in backend/requirements.txt, including flask
3. To start a development server, run "flask start".  To run in debug mode (automatically refresh on code changes), run "FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run"

### NHL API
The publicly accessible NHL API is used by the NHL to power their site as well as other web resources.  It has also been documented by interested hockey fans and developers.  Check out this public repo by Drew Hynes documenting the various endpoints: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/tree/master


## Frontend
The design and implementation of the frontend is left entirely up to you.  Please place your code in the /frontend directory.
